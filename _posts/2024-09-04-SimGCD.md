## Research Task
**Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)** relaxes the assumption of traditional semi-supervised learning by assuming the unlabelled data can also contain different but related categories from the labelled data. The goal of GCD is to learn a model that is able to classify the already-seen categories in the labelled data, and more importantly, jointly discover the new categories in the unlabelled data and make correct classifications.

## Limitations of Previous Methods
Previous methods can be divided into 2 paths.
1) parametric classifiers.
However, parametric classifiers are prone to overfit to seen categories.
This **motivates** us to revisit the reason that makes previous parametric classifiers fail to recognise novel classes.
2) non-parametric classifier such as k-means clustering.
Albeit obtaining promising results, the non-parametric classifiers suffer from heavy computation costs on large-scale datasets due to quadratic complexity of the clustering algorithm.
Besides, unlike a learnable parametric classifier, the non-parametric method loses the ability to jointly optimise the separating hyperplane of all categories in a learnable manner, potentially being sub-optimal.
