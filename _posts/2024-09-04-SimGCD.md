## Research Task
{* Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) *} relaxes the assumption of traditional semi-supervised learning by assuming the unlabelled data can also contain different but related categories from the labelled data. The goal of GCD is to learn a model that is able to classify the already-seen categories in the labelled data, and more importantly, jointly discover the new categories in the unlabelled data and make correct classifications.

## Limitations of Previous Methods
Previous methods can be divided into 2 paths.
The first is to use parametric classifiers. However, parametric classifiers are prone to overfit to seen categories.
The other is to use non-parametric classifier such as k-means clustering. Albeit obtaining promising results, the non-parametric classifiers suffer from heavy computation costs on large-scale datasets due to quadratic complexity of the clustering algorithm.
